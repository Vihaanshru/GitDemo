}
Output:Woof
Since both the classes, child class and parent class have the same method animalSound. 
Which of the method will be called is determined at runtime by JVM.

Few more overriding examples:

Animal obj = new Animal();
obj.animalSound();
// This would call the Animal class method

Dog obj = new Dog();
obj.animalSound();
// This would call the Dog class method

Animal obj = new Dog();
obj.animalSound();
// This would call the Dog class method
		 */

	}

}
