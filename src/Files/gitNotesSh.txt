GIT NOTES:
GIT STEPS:

1.Create repo in github account
2.Before doing any operation gitrepo/git has to know which user is doing these operatons.so use your
 email id and name using command prompt.

we can use tortise git-ui-to talk to git
or using eclipse,intellij etc. but we will use command prompt.

Commands:

1.git config(config meaning -Set) --global(if you set global you can accessit anywhere from system) user.name "shruti"

2 Step: create folder(gitstuff)-put a dummy project(or real proj) to push to repo.
3.from command prompt go to the dir created

cd gitstuff

4.make git hub to understand your folder you created using git init command

git init---initialize git file into your current proj(gitstuff).

for git to read your code git initialize one file in your proj folder ,it opens that and reads your proj.by default its
not present.we need to initalize it by using git init

git init.

now we can push our code to github

very imp:WATCH it


1.you have code
2.Initialize it as Git repository--yes done using git init command
3.Add your code to stash. 

what is stash and comit?


there is GITHUB-
when you give command to github to push your code it will look into/ for code which is commited.it will not
look for code which is not commited

For ex: 100files i edited---80 i want to commit and 20 files i dont want to commit..Git hub
will look for 80 files andpublish into repo.

if you dont comit anything and simply push ,github will complain saying there is nothing for me to accept.because there 
are no comits.

what is stash:? when we develop something its in stash then it goes to commit.
its like stash is first level of commit say commit 1 and actuall commit is commit 2


ORDER IS LIKE THIS:

GITHUB--->takes code from Commit which are commited---->Commit takes code which are in stash only.

So if you want to add anything to github you need to add your code to stash.Then commit the stash and store it in commit 
and then push to github finally


How to add our code to stash.?
Below steps follow
Move our local code to stash using below command


git add *     (add-add code to stash , * -->add everythig)(commit level1)-you can add individual name
Entire code is moved to stash

git status     (what are the files added to the stash)

**remeber staging and stash are same(commit 1)
our code is in staging in the below diag.
staging<--commit(next step )

Now commit2 or just commit will look for code in staging/stash
use below command for that

git commit -m "first message"   (commit stands for commiting from staging and -m is for addingmesasge-always add msg)



after this command our code is in commit step in below diag

staging<---commit.
now from commit it should be pushed to github




three basic steps (initila steps)
git add *---for staging
git commit -m "" -------for commiting.
git push


-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now before pushing code we need to give an address to where to push..
our github is remote repository(remote server) and my code in laptop folder(gitstuff) is local repo.
"WE NEED TO FORM A CONNECTION BWN THESE 2 AND THEN PUSH." below is the command for same.

git, remote, add the origin  (git remote-make a remote connection ,add the origin,here origin is the github remote repo url)

exact command is:

git remote add origin https://github.com/Vihaanshru/GitDemo.git

now remote repo is successfully connected to local repo.


Now push code from local to remote repo--git push to the origin command

Exact command:   git push -u origin master  or git push origin master(same)
(here no need to say origin url as it is already registered) and we are no master branch --later explained.

when we create a repository in github, branch is always master.-very imp remeber this.

after doing this you should see in github

this is for creating new repo and do it.

next note pad is how to get already existing code into local---by cloning..


Go to command prompt:

//clone is used to get the code for "First time only"
//pull is used to get updates what happened(new code) after clone 


git clone https://github.com/Vihaanshru/GitDemo.git   (go to clone button and get from repo)


this should have created this repo in our local machine(git demo into vihaan folder)
so X person created GITSTUFF-uploaded to git repo in github creating GITDemo repository.
Y person downloaded into local--it is now saved as GitDemoFolder project for him


Now import this project(gitDEmo) into eclipse and make some changes:

GITDEMO--Downloaded
GIT X(GITSTUFF)-created it


GITDEMO user--edited code in gitdemo proj by gitdemo user

first step is to stash or stage changes
(git add *)

1.go to folder where demoproj is(i.e inside git demo) not to just vihaan folder)inside git demo we have fiels)
C:\Users\Vihaan\GitDemo
2.git add *
3.see what files got added using git status.(save files before git add *) otherwise you see those files in red color
(this is called staging) otherwise it will show in red(msg:untracked files something like this
after saving files do git status, it should show in green

4.do git commit using git commit -m "message"

5.then push(before that do the connection git commands.)
git remote add origin (for first time,but if you are doing in same instance not needed


6.now do git push origin master
//go to github and see the changes are reflecting--yes reflecting


Now next guy comes and takes this code(git x---git stuff) go to local repo(on laptop)he will not have this change)


Once he comes to office he needs to take the PULL before making his changes--BEST PRACTICE--ALWAYS FOLLOW.


go back to vihaan folder cd .. and go to GITSTUFF folder(git x guy)
C:\Users\Vihaan\GitDemo>cd ..

C:\Users\Vihaan>cd gitstuff

C:\Users\Vihaan\GITSTUFF>


for latest changes only use git pull from where?? origin  which branch master?


exact comand   : git pull origin master

(if you have any files changed but dont want to commit or not sure of what changes u have -its 
ok to loose changes then do git reset --hard)

check by using git status

Now assume gitstuff guy does somechanges in same file(anagram) and some other file


do git add * for staging first step(this is done without saving files--showing red still-to 
see what happens)

perform git commit now using git commit -m"american guy"


do git push origin master

go as gitdemo cd..
cd git demo

do git pull origin master

che ck if it is updated --yes 


BRANCH CONCEPT:


scenario why branching is imp:

GITStuff--X guy
GITDEMo--Yguy

in a company we needd enhancement framework. not tcs update.both need to work on framework 
componenet. when this happens, all tcs fail .(ex: implementing bdd with pom instead of tdd)

But we need regular tcs -for ergression to be run also.

In that case we take a branch ..from master branch..sub branch..it will have same code as master
branch.

Architect changes will happen on branch.in this case we call as develop branch.
usually second branch is called develop branch in company.

Once like after a month development is complete on aframework arichitect they merge with master branch.

Start branch operations here------------------------------

Now we are in git demo.(Asian guy)


go to git demo-he needs to take a branch(cut a branch is called)
command is
git checkout -b <branchname> (-b stands for creating new branch/or cutting the branch from main master,checkout stands for checkout master code)
(so basically it copied the master repo and created a branch with different name and same code)


ex:

git checkout -b develop

when u enter this command it says switched to a new branch develop

if you want to kknow on which branhc you are in enter "git branch"command .
exact command:  git branch,whichever branch you are in is shown with * and green color
even in eclipse it tells you are in brnach that you created and not in master.
check next to project-it says develop and not master

now you can make changes in this branch (in eclipse-change some files)and it will not disturb master.

push to staging
commit
push to develop branch (not master branch)---this is very important,pls remeber.

we created a branch which has same code as master called develop branch--worked on it--push back to develop branch only.(after merge it goes to master)

after pushing this changes to develop ,WE CHOULD SEE THE BRANCH WE CREATED " in git hub

command is:

git push origin develop

go to github and switch to develop branch which is now created thru above command to see the changes

in git hub it says"This branch is 1 commit ahead of master." when you switch to develop branch

Now go back to GITSTUFF guy 
cd ..
cd GITSTUFF


now this guy also has to work on develop branch

take a pull of git branch develop...

exact command:

git pull origin develop  
enter
he will have code in his machine with all changes done by gitdemo guy but he is still on master branch,he needs to switch to develop
branch. how to switch from master branch to develop branch?
exact command to enter:
git checkout develop
(here dont use -b because we are not creating new branch,we are using the existing branch created by other guy called develop.)
Now check in eclipse: you can see git stuff is on develop branch now with all cahnges made by him as well.

Now make changes by this gitstuff.
edit some code and perform same operation again.

(we will discuss merge conflict later,continue the flow now)
Add another file called git stuff

save changes-->git stage/stash-->commit --->push to develop 
go to git hub and see the changes reflected

Ingit hub for develop changes it says:
This branch is 2 commits ahead of master.

now the develop code is full ready and ready to be merged to master.

how to push to master and merge?? and make into one powerfull framework.

STEPS:
first go to master branch
1.Switch to master branch
//git checkout master

2.Take a pull so that we have latest code from the repository and we are upto date with it.
//git pull origin master
it should say already uptodate .

3.Now to merge both use command:
git merge develop(here always give branch which you want to merge with the active branch .i.e branch which ur in currently=master here)
//git merge develop

4. Now the code is merged and you can see that your branch in eclipse is switched to master and all the changes from develop is seen 
on Master branch as well

DONE HERE.

Now add one more file quickly by gitstuff and push, we still need to get gitdemo guyy to master..we only made gitstuff to master.


Now switch to git demo workspace cd ..
cd gitdemo
here you are in develop branch still--go to master branch
by using 
//git checkout master
and do git pull origin master-to get latest code
//git pull origin master


now go to eclipse and see--you should be on master branch with all the lates changes upto date(also the extra file line added)


--MERGE CONFLICTS---------------------------------------------------------------------***************************************

In what cases you get merge conflicts??

add text file --and save with .txt and save it by--(git demo guy only).
save under src/test/java/packagename/here

make sure ur in master branch.
add this single file instead of *
pass link

git add C:\Users\Vihaan\GitDemo\src\JavaCodingQues\names.txt

now do git commit -m "names file added"
enter
(DONT PUSH CHANGES YET)

now create new branch here DEVELOP2

git checkout -b develop2
add numbers to same file save
do git add
git commit -m "added numbers in same file"

DONT COMMIT YET
SHIFT TO MASTER BRANCH NOW

{there should be 2 comits--1 in master 1 in develop2)

Now in master branch you dont see the changes done by develop2 branches(numbers that were added)

now master branch guy decided to remove the alpnhabets written like removed abc (he will not see the numbers added by develop2guy) and now commited code but
develop2 guy dosent have these new changes he still see all alphabets .

for commiting by master branch guy--
do git add C:\Users\Vihaan\GitDemo\src\JavaCodingQues\names.txt 

git commit -m "alphabets removed"

go to develop2 branch--git checkout develop2.
you dont see the new changes(alphabets removed)

you still see all aplhabets and numbers(he wont see the alphabets that were removed changes)

develop2guy will now add more numbers and DECIDED TO MERGE WITH MAIN CODE-MASTER)
do git add C:\Users\Vihaan\GitDemo\src\JavaCodingQues\names.txt
git commit -m "merge all"
then use below comamnd
SO HE WILL USE COMMAND:
git merge master(because he wants to add master code to his code and make one single code)

but master code dosent know which code it should take the one he already had or the lates where alph were removed--it throws conflict error here

Go to file and remove everything under Head <<<<<and everything under MASTER <<<<<<<<<<<<< tags(We need to coordinate with other guy personally
and do it)
ok after doing how do we know it is resolved??


I did not see (because 99 times it resolves conflict) only 1 % it is conflicting

So commit again now and see
by doing git add
git commit and now do git merge master
dont panic..look for file changes and resolve by talking to other guy.


come back to develop2 /refresh and see you will see the changes
